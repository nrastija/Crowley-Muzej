# About
This project is part of the Basics of Web Technologies course in the second year of my undergraduate studies. It showcases my understanding of web technlogies, including design patterns with coding in HTML, CSS and JS. Through this project, I aim to demonstrate my rising proficiency in Front End Web development, as well as aiming to improve my creativity.

# Project Title
Basics of Web Technology Project

## Domain Description
The project involves the development of a dynamic web application that seamlessly integrates both front-end and back-end technologies. The objective is to create a versatile and responsive web page that adapts to various devices and screen sizes, providing an optimal user experience. This project aims to demonstrate the ability to implement modern web design patterns and coding practices using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while also incorporating server-side functionalities.

## Project Specification
The project will deliver a fully functional web application with the following key features:

* Responsive Design: The application will be designed to automatically adjust its layout and content based on the screen size and device type, ensuring usability across desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

* Front-End Capabilities:
        User Interface: Develop an intuitive and visually appealing user interface using HTML and CSS. This will include well-structured navigation, interactive elements, and a consistent design theme.
        Interactive Features: Implement dynamic functionalities using JavaScript to enhance user engagement. This may include forms with real-time validation, animations, and interactive content.

* Back-End Capabilities:
        Server-Side Integration: Design and develop server-side functionality to handle requested backend operations. This will involve using server-side technologies and integrating them with the front-end interface.

* Seamless Integration: Ensure that the front-end and back-end components work together smoothly, providing a cohesive user experience. This includes implementing appropriate APIs and ensuring secure communication between client and server.

* Accessibility and Performance: Optimize the web application for performance and accessibility, adhering to best practices to ensure fast load times and inclusivity for all users.

* Documentation and Testing: Provide thorough documentation for both the code and the usage of the application. Implement comprehensive testing to ensure functionality, usability, and security are up to standard.
